## Keyword Substitution
Notes for work done to merge keyword substitution feature into the EdX codebase

To get the feature merged, need to:
- Get separate anon_user_id PR merged first
- Have initial PR that implements feature only for Bulk Email
    - Needs to contain validation
- Then add separate PR that extends feature to course announcements

## Current PR notes
- It looks like Se Won already wrote in validations..?
