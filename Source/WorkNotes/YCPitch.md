# Pitch:
Companies currently incur no clear external reinforcement or social cost based on cultural accessibility to women. We are an anonymous review forum to rate companies based on women's experiences. By highlighting these voices, we provide a service to those entering tech and use often overlooked stories to change workplace culture.
