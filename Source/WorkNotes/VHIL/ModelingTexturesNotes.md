# Modeling Textures Notes
All work is done in 3DS Max

- First, download Vizard 4 & 5 Exporters
- All materials and textures work is done in the Slate Material Editor view
- Textures Vs. Materials
    - Materials are shaders
        - When the program draws the object, it describes how the object interacts with the light source
    - Textures allow you to define color values to pixels on object's surface
- [cgtextures](http://www.cgtextures.com) is where you can get a bunch of free textures

## UV Mapping
- Be sure that any models you download/create have a UV map
- Ensure your textures have all the parameters you need

## Exporting
When exporting, the type should be OpenSceneGraph (.osg)
- In dialog box, make sure that:
    - all map selections are checked
    - Embed in binary file option selected
- Settings for exporting to Vizard: [OSG Exporter](http://docs.worldviz.com/vizard/#exporting.htm%3FTocPath%3DContent%20Creation|3D%20Models|3ds%20Max%20Workflow|_____1)
