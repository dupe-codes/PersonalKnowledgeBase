# Adora Cheung, founder of Homejoy
Building Product, Talking to Users, and Growing 

# Pre-Requisites
- Have a lot of time on your hand
    - Better to spend a few days in a row focused solely on your idea than to spend a few hours here and there
    - Kind of like coding

# The nOOb approach
1. Build product in secret
2. exclusive press launch!
3. wait for users
4. buy users
5. give up
Adora: I didnt even launch on techcrunch when in YC, which was a bad idea.

# Problem
What is it? You should be able to describe it in one sentence.
How does it relate to you? You need to be passionate
Verify others have it - go out and talk to people!

Adora: when my brother and I started our first company, we wanted to make people happy and wanted to be impactful
    - We asked, who make people happy? Life coaches and therapists.
    So, we made a platform for them.
    - But, we are not people who would use life coaches and therapists... so we were not passionate about it

# Where to start?
- Learn a lot. Become an expert.
    - Immerse yourself in your chosen industry
    - Become a cog in it
    - People say "to disrupt an industry, you should not be a player in it. You would be set in your ways."
        - But as a noob, you really need to understand the bits and pieces of your industry
        - When you get down to the bits and pieces, you can find what you can exploit
    - Adora: When we started Homejoy, we started by just being cleaner. We cleaned houses ourselves.
        - We learned that we were really bad at it.. we bought books to read, but you can not learn just by reading
        - We decided one of us needed to learn how to clean, so we went to get a job at a cleaning company ourselves
        - Learned to clean, but even better I learned about how a local cleaning company works
            - Learned why a local cleaning company could not grow to the size Homejoy is today
    - If working on a service, you should go do that service yourself. Get in your customers shoes
    - You should be obsessed.
        - Look into EVERY competitor, read everything you can find about them
    - There should be no doubt you are an expert so people can trust what you are building
- Identify customer segments
    - At the early stages, you want to focus on a small segment of your customers to really optimize the experience
- Storyboard ideal user experience
    - Not just the website, but also how the customer finds out about you, learns about you, what you are communicating, etc.
    - Also go into what happens after they use your product. Do they leave a review, or leave comments?

# What is V1?
- Minimal Viable Product
    - A lot of people skip the viable part. The user experience at the beginning should not be flat
    - What is the smallest feature set to solve the problem you are trying to solve.
- Simple product positioning
    - You should be able to go to a person and say "this does x y and x" within a sentence
        - At HomeJoy, we started off with something really complicated. People would get bored after the first few sentences. 
        - The oneliner is really important, it describes the functional benefits of what you are building

# First few users
- YOU! 
- Your mom, friends, + co-workers
- Beyond that you should get more user feedback
    - Online communities, e.g. HN, reddit
    - Local communities, e.g. mailing lists
    - niche influencers, e.g. mommy bloggers
    - cold calls + emails
    - press
Adora: Went to a Castro street fair and handed out water bottles on a hot day... Kinda guilt tripped them into booking a cleaning, but it worked, people did not cancel
- Another YC company replacing the process of shipping things went to post office lines and got people out of line and tried to convince them to use their product. - Shype maybe?

# Customer Feedback
Make sure there is a way for people to contact you!
- support@blank.com is very important!
- Need to get out there and ask people who are using your product what they think
- surveys: ok// interviews: better
    - In interviews, do not treat it like a laboratory setting, poking with questions
    - Treat it was a conversation, make people comfortable.
    - Adora: I found taking people out for drinks was a great way to do that!
- quantitative: retention, ratings, NPS
    - Are people who came in today still using our product tomorrow?
    - How likely are they to reccommend the product to a friend?
- qualitative: ask why, why, why
- beware of honesty curve
    - Free Product:
        - Mom kinda honest
        - Your friends will give you some good honest feedback, support you
        - Random people? Do not really care, not the best feedback
    - Paid product:
        - Mom will flat out lie, she is proud of you
        - Friends still pretty honest
        - But random customers will be REALLY honest, because they are paying a price for your product

# v1 feature creep
- Build fast, but optimize for now
- manual before automation
    - Process is important as you scale, but you should manually do things your self
        - Need to learn what the automation should do
- Temp brokenness > permanent analysis
    - Do not worry about all the edge cases, worry about the generic case.
    - Then as you get bigger, the volume of the edge cases will excuse and then you can tackle them
- Beware of frankenstein
    - You should listen to user feedback
    - But when someone tells you to build a feature, you should not go and build it right away
        - Get to the bottom line of why they are asking for that feature
        - Usually what they are suggesting is not the best way to solve the underlying problem

# s is for stealth, and stupid
- Someone will steal your idea...
    - If you have a really good idea, someone is gonna try to catch up with you
    - No point in holding out on all the user feedback you would get
- There is a first-mover advntage
... just launch it already!

# ready for a lot of users?
You will be tempted to try many different strategies for growth at once. But you should instead: 
- Learn one channel at a time
    - Focus on one strategy for a week or so, and figure out how it works
- iterate working channels
    - When you find channels that work, always iterate to make them better
    - Channels always change, you need to change with them
    - Environments you do not control change all the time
- revisit failed channels

key = creativity

# types of growth
1. sticky growth
    - Try to get your existing users to come back and pay you more
2. viral growth
    - Users tell their friends
3. paid growth
    - Use your money to buy growth

key = sustainability

## Sticky Growth
- good experience wins
- clv + retention cohort analysis important
- repeat users buy more and more

## virawl growth
WOW experience + good referral programs
1. customer touch points
    - Where are people learning that they can refer other people
    - Put touch point at a time when they are highly engaged and loving you
2. program mechanics
    - You get $10 and your friend gets $10 if you invite them
    - Optimize for what works for you
3. referral conversion flow
    - Optimize the conversion flow of a friend who was referred becoming a new user

# the art of pivoting
Look at these three criteria
1. bad growth
2. bad retention
3. bad economics

You should have a growth plan when you start out, what is an optimistic but realistic way to grow this business
If fully executing and working really hard, but you still go 3 or more weeks without any growth, then you are probably doing something wrong and need to reevaluate your approach/product
Make sure you do not stop if you are just in a lull. Trends are what matter
