# Competition is for Losers

## Capturing Value
- A business creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of X. X and Y are independent variables

If you just measured by revenue, you could say that the airline industry is larger and more important than the search industry.
But the profit margins are much less (Airlines: 0.2%, Google: 21.0%), and reflected in market capitalization (Airlines: 112.4B, Google: 393B)

# Perfect Competition
| pros | cons | 
|------|------|
| easy to model| psychologically unhealthy |
| efficient in a static world | irrelevant in a dynamic world |
| politically salable | preempts question of value |

- Other end of the spectrum... Monopoly

| pros | cons |
| ---- | ----- |
| incentive to innovate | lower output, higher prices |
| stable, longterm planning | price discrimination |
| deeper project financing | stifle innovation |
|symptomatic of creation | tying|

- Two types of businesses: Monopolies and ones that are perfectly competitive

# Lies people Tell
- Differences underestimated
- Anyone who has a monopoly will pretend that they are in incredible competition
- If you are in a very competitive business, you will say you are doing something unique that is less competitive than it looks
- The real differences are quite big
    - The distortion happens because of the lies people tell about their businesses
## Narratives
| non-monopolies| monopolies |
| ---------------| ---------|
| We are in a narrow market | We are in a huge market |
| Relevant Market: Insterection of markets | Relevant Market: Union of markts|

## British Food in Palo Alto
Restaurants are a terrible business. 
- We are the only British Food restaurant in Palo Alto.
    - Too small a market
    - No people who eat nothing but British Food
## Blockbuster Movie
- College football star joins elite group of hackers to catch the shark that killed his friend...
- Lots of movies, just another movie

## Is the intersection valuable?
Startup Versions:
- Sharing
- Movile
- Social
- Apps
- Sharing mobile social apps...

## The Opposite Lie: Monopolies
Google has a 66.4% market share of the search market
- Google almost never describes itself as a search engine
    - Sometimes says it is an advertisement company
        - But search advertising is a tiny part of the entire advertising industry
    - Can also call itself a technology company
        - But again, the technology market is incredibly large
        - Lots of competitors

## Evidence of narrow markets
Big tech companies have incredibly high profit margins
Tech ecosystem successful because its prone to creating huge monopolies

# Start small and Monopolize
- If you are a startup and want to get to monopoly, you need to start with a really small market
    - Over time then find ways to expand the market
- Its easier to dominate a small market than a larger one
- Bad sign if you go after a large market from the beginning

## Problem with Cleantech Companies
- Start big and shrink...
- You do not want to be the 100th restaurant in Palo Alto
- Large existing markets tend to mean that theres tons of competition and its hard to distinguish yourself

# Last Mover Advantage
## Characteristics of Monopoly:
- Proprietary Tech
    - Have a tech that is an order of magnitude better than the alternative
    - If you come up with something totally new, it is an infinite improvement
- Network effects
    - Thing that is tricky: They are often very hard to get started
    - Why is it valuable to the first person?
- Economies of scale
    - High fixed cost, low marginal cost
- Branding
    - It should not just be about branding
    - But branding is a real phenomenon that creates real value
> The next Bill Gates will not build Microsoft... If you are copying these people, you are doing it wrong

- Software businesses are exceptionally good at a lot of these characteristics, especially economies of scale. Its very easy to scale.
- Its not enough just to have a monopoly, you want to build one that will last
- You want to be the last mover
    - Google = the last search engine
    - Microsoft = the last OS (for a while)
- Most of the value exists far in the future
    - We overvalue growth rates and undervalue the founders abilities
- There is a time dimension to all the characteristics above... Will they carry on over time? Grow stronger?
- Need to explain why your breakthrough will be the last breakthrough, need to keep improving on it

# History of innovation
- Not all great innovations lead to reward for the innovator
- Its very rare that people grabbed a portion of the value of some innovation
    - Very rare that anyone ever makes money
## Success Cases
- Two kinds of cases that found success
    - Vertically Integrated complex monopolies
        - Ford, Standard, Oil, Tesla, SpaceX
        - Required complex coordination, when done well gives you an incredible advantage
        - Hard to buy in to things that are super complicated
        - People would do well to look at this model of business more
    - Software
        - Economies of scale, low marginal cost, high adoption rate
        - You can get very fast adoption when working in the world of bits

# Psychology of Competiton
- We always think of the losers as those who are not good at competiting
    - Peter wants us to rethink this and think that maybe we do not understand the effects of competition
    - We find ourselves very attracted to competition
- Something about human nature is very sheeplike
## Competition vs Validation
- We go for things that lots of other people are going for
    - Intensity of competition seems to give validation
