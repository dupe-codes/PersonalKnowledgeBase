# 9/23/14 \- History of Global Events

# Political Map Discussion

## Soveriegn State
- an entity that has a monopoly on violent authority
- No other groups exist that challenge its power

    ## Example: Lebanon
    - Defined as a country based on political map, but groups like Hezbollah challenge
    its authority...

Map shows the way they global governing powers WANT us to see the world

## Arc of Instability
- A proposed, interconnected chain of politically unstable nation states
- Certain parts of the world are more unstable than others

Even in nations with democratic processes, there are challenges to the notion of the nation-state

# Syria
- Pro-Assad Forces: The official government of Syria
    - Assad family had ruled Syria with an iron-fist for decades
    - Armed rebellion has broken up into many different groups
    - But government was pretty secular
- Free Syrian Army
    - Original opposition forces
    - Very moderate
    - United States government is now working with and arming them
    - But its splintered and lost support, and is a shadow of what it used to be
- Kurds
    - Tend to be muslim but not Islamist
    - More concerned with Kurdish nationalism
    - Has some support from Christians in Syria
        - Christians have mostly supported the Syrian government because of its tolerance of
        religious diversity

# The Islamic State
- Has been growing very rapidly
    - Estimates of number of fighters has grown from 2-3,000 to over 50,000
    - Flag is the black flag, echoing the story of the Black Flags of Khorasan
        - prophecies of the prophet Muhammad, state a non-stop army will rise from the land of
        Khorasan and conquer vast swatches of land in the end times
    - Goes by many names:
        - Islamic State of the Levant
        - Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
        - Or just Islamic State
    - One possible goal is to unite all islamic states into one global Caliphate
    - Visions of the caliphate includes all areas where muslims have lived and ruled

    ## Qatar
    - Richest country in the world (on a per capita basis)
    - Lots of indication that wealthy individuals in Arab countries such as Qatar are funcding ISIS

    ## Foreign Fighters
    - Many fighters from foreign lands, including the West, are reportedly flooding to support ISIS

    ## Areas of Control
    - Reported areas of ISIS control are centered around rivers (such as the Euphrates) and supply corridors

# Kurds
- Since the 1990s, northern area of Iraq has been controlled by an semi-independent Kurdish state
- They recognize the Iraqi government, but operate independently
    - Have their own military, the Pershmerga
        Those who face death
- Called the largest nation without a state
- The Kurds are getting stronger with a relatively powerful military
    - There is a lot of concern in Turkey and Iran because of this
- US does not want an independent Kurdish state
    - Because Turkey is a NATO ally
- Kurdish has aspirations for a Kurdish state that would take chunks of land from Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria

# Back to Syria
- Pro-government forces today are fairing much better than they were a year ago, when it seemed to be on the verge of collapse

It is not a war about oil, but it is an important consideration
    - Because it can be sold, big source of revenue

## The Yazidi
- Unique religion that makes them the target of hardcore islamists because of their worship of
Melek Taus (The Peacock Angel), associated with satan
    - Hardcore islamists call this devil worship
    - But Yazidi believe Melek Taus repented and was forgiven, so not really devil worship in most senses
- Yazidis were trapped by ISIS in the Sinjar region, but most able to escape to Kurdish lands

## Kobane (Ayn Al Arab) kurdish Region in Northern Syria
- Formally under Kurdish control, but as of last week ISIS has been making advances and gaining a lot of ground
- Hundreds of thousands of refuges crossed the border into Turkey

## Last night
- U.S. and partners began airstrikes against ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria

# Gender Issues

## Islamic State
- Considered highly Misogynistic
- Very brutal, have sold thousands of Yazidis as sex slaves
- Reports of using women as human shields
- Raping woman to populate the Caliphate

## Kurdish Syrian Militia
- It might be that there has never been such a large force of female figthers in history
- Reportedly up to a third of Kurdish Syrian Militants are women
- Recruiting women to have kids and cook
