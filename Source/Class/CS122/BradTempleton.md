# Brad Templeton
Identity, Free Will, Consciousness, Patternism, Copyable People and Would you get in the Transporter?
The meaning of existence

There are a lot of implications of the idea of a mind that can be copied.
Templetons Fundamental Theorem of AI: If we have figured out how to do something, it is no longer AI

Star Trek Transporter:
- Vaporizes Captain Kirk and makes a copy of him down on the planet...
- Brings up many questions about the nature of continuity and consciousness

## Consciousness
- Never going to agree on what it is
- We know more than some imagine
- Probably present in all mammals, some birds, octupus
    - Things associated with consciousness (Dreaming, etc) have been observed to occur in the parts of our mind that we share with these animals
- An artifact of the brain, or at least all physical evidence says this
    - Materialist belives that everything we see and know comes from material things
    - There is nothing supernatural
    - Generally non-religious
    - Even the deepest emotions, religious experiences, and altered states
- Unconcious activity precedes conscious awareness
    - Example, decision to pick up a bottle of water occurs before we are even aware of it
    - This bothers people, maybe our mind is more like a parliament with a queen... the parliament makes the decision, the queen is just a figure head.
    - Maybe our inner dialogue is just an illusion
        - Brad: I think this is a misunderstanding of complex systems to think this.. We are complex systems, making decisions is a complex behavior so of course there is a lot of work unknown to us that must be done to accomplish it

## Materialistic View
- Mind and identity are products of the very physical brain
- The brain is an evolved system
- Its properties come from natural or sexual selection, plus upbringing
- Upbringing and environment also plays a big role

## Dualism
Idea that the mind and the body are two different things.. the mind/body problem.
- Idea of a soul is a dualist view, because it is separate from the body

## Definitions of Intelligence
- Turings test (updated)
    - You have intelligence if you behave at the level of humans in certain tasks
    - If you have something that is so like a human, maybe that is a definition of what is a human being?
    - Turns out it is easier than we thought to fool people into believing a machine is human.
    - If you doubt Turing, could you still be sure enough to deny rights?
- Searles chinese room
    - Very opposite view from Turing
    - You can imagine an AI that is in a room filled with chinese books, and looking up the write chinese to say to have a discussion with someome in chinese
- Chalmers philosophical zombies
    - The idea that you could make a mind that to the outside appears exactly like a mind
    - In the movie Her we demonstrate a human falling in love with an AI
        - Chalmer would call it a philosophical zombie. It walks like a man but is dead inside...

## Its a simulation!
A dirty word
    - It has an implication of not being real. Its fake
    - Its prejudging the question
    - As people have gotten better at VR, philosopher at Oxford proposed a thesis that states:
        - If you imagine at some point tech becomes advanced enough to create a convincingly believable virtual reality.
        - Would we build such a thing?
            - Yes, probably
        - How many times would we build it?
            - As often as possible
        - How do you know you are in the original? Whats the probability you are in the original... pretty small
        - A weird proof of God.. though God is a programmer named Martha
Bostrum and others "prove" we are in one
Its turtles all the way up

## Copyable People
- AIs
- Uploaded People
    - We look at the fact that our brains seem to be material objects.. But are wetbags of protein the only way you could have an intelligent mind
    - We able to make other intelligent minds... our offspring are intelligent midns created by use
    - Is it possible to copy the patterns of the mind into another medium?
    - If you can make a synthetic neuron which acts in everyway we can tell as a normal neuron, then a connection of neurons indistinguishable from the biological ones, and read the copy of connections in the mind of a human being... what would happen?
        - Could you copy the mind, an artificial copy of an actual mind

-Transporter Beam/Replicator
    - Lots of great Science Fiction

## Patternism
- The pattern is the identity
    - Not in the physical things, but in the information
- Waves in the river
    - They are formed by the arrangement of water molecules
- Ship of Theseus, Neuron by Neuron replacement
    - Ancient Greek Philosopher posited that a ship goes out to sea. As it travels, things rot and are replaced. 
        - When the Ship finally comes back, every single part of the ship has been replaced... Is it still the Ship of Theseus???
    - What if we do this with nuerons in the brain.. Replace all the neurons in th ebrain with exact copies
        - Are you still you? If you are dead, when did you die?
- Your atoms replace, as do your cells (mostly)
    - The atoms in your body keep getting replaced
    - Part of the natural process
    - Your brain is a redundant organ, your memories and such are stored in many places in the brain
    - You are not the same matter you started off as
- Identity is continuity of pattern through incremental change
    - A path of succession, a chain of connected successors
        - You can see this between your present self and your ten year old self
- Identity continues through successors
- Unusual mix of Dualism and Materialism
    - the pattern is in the matter, but continuity is independent of matter

## Basic Copying
What if you could make a copy of yourself, what does this mean for...

- Voting
    - Do you then get two votes? Or just one? Which one gets the vote?
    - If both gets a vote, it comes down to resources
         - Those with more money make more copies and gain more votes
- Property Ownership
    - Does the original own all the property?
    - Some would say it would be unethical for you to make a copy and then not give any support to them
    - We lock people up if they dont provide some support to their offspring
- Is there truly an original and a copy?
    - Patternist would say no, the 'copy' has an identical pattern..
- Does the copy owe the original?
- Does the original owe the copy?
- Is there a duty to keep a mind running?
    - Is it murder to 'pause' or 'delete' a copy?
- Are evolutionary algorithms moral?
    - Have some software go through different variations and measure performance... keep the ones that perform well
    - Scientists believe that we could produce AI in this way in such a way we would not fully understand
    - Ethics question: Deliberately killing off millions of copies...

## Forking with Versed
Possible to have two copies of yourself
Drug versed makes it impossible to remember events...
After taking versed, have a conversation with someone, and then you wake up and do not remember the conversation
I have done it

- Is the person who had the conversation the same person? The memories are gone.
    - The person is a fork of the original, destined to be replaced by the original person who will not recollect the conversation
- Suggests quantum state and ephemeral elements not crucial to identity, consciousness
- People who get head trauma or flatline forget many minutes before

## Two Originals!
- Single celled organism
- Redundant brain
- Split brain
- B(T) => BA(T + 1) + BB(T+1)
- Which is the ogiinal?
- Is B(T) still alive? Is the predessor still alive if BA is destroyed and BB lives?
- Digital Brain swapped out to disk
- Digital Brain moving along a wire
