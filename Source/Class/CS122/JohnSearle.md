## Obvious Mistake in AI
- They had a program that could answer questions about some given story
- They had a story understanding program
    - But just following a rule book called a 'program'
- Leads to Seales Chinese Room theory

- Syntax is not semantics. Simulation is not duplication.
    - You can give a perfect simulation of story understanding but it is not really
    understanding
    - Computer just shuffles syntax

- Searle gave this viewpoint at a Yale AI conference, and no one had thought of it before
    - Got a lot of different arguments against it
    - Such as the 'systems' reply
        - The person in the room is just a small part of a larger system
        - Seale: "So the room is what understands chinese?"

# Deeper Philosophical Questions
## Objectivity and Subjectivity
- Its an ambiguous questions
- Epistemic vs Ontological
    - Rembrandt was born in blank - an epistemic objective claim
    - Rembrand was the greatest artist ever born - an epistemic subjective claim
    - Epistemic is the study of knowledge
- Ontological is the study of being and existence
- Consciousness is ontologically subjective
    - Only exists as far as someone experiences it
    - But you can still have an ontologically objective study of the science
- But we cannot study consciousness because its subjective and science is objective...
    - A fallacy, does not mean we cannot have something objective that studies the subjective

- Observer Independent vs Observer Relative
    - A lot of features of the world are observer relative
        - Its a nice day for a picnic
        - Something is money, or property, or government is only relative to the fact that we think they are so
        - Money is only money because we accept the fact that it is
    - But the system of use surrounding money is epistemically objective
        - No one says "I don't know what you think but this is not money" when I hand them money

- In Alan Turings day, a computer was someone/something that did computing
    - Today computers only refer to the machines that do computation

- Except for computations performed by actual human beings, all computations are observer relative
    - Just electrons moving in a circuit which we interpret as a computation

- In initrinsic, observer independent sense, Deep Blue has NO intelligence, and cannot play chess
    - But in observer relative sense, it does. We choose to believe so

Searles Further Claim: The PHYSICS is not sufficient to define the syntax

> The conscious mind is an island in the sea of unconscious thought
