List of Preferred Tools
=======================

|       Tool        |       Purpose     |       Notes       |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Trello            | General Project Goals/tasks| Good for high level project assignments and TODOs                 |
| GitHub Issues + Waffle.io | Technical TODOs/Issue-Tracking | We'll use these tools to keep track of bugs and assign specific work on the technical side of things |
| Evernote? | Documents/Work specific communication | I want to look into this further, but Evernote might be a nice tool to use for planning feature stories and storing company wide documents |
| Google Docs/Dropbox? | Documents | If we don't go with evernote, google docs or Dropbox will be the alternative for storing documents such as feature stories. |
| HipChat or Slack | Team communication | We'll use this for 24/7 team communication. Need to choose between HipChat and Slack. I'm leaning towards hipchat. |
| Email | Longer messages to the team | Email will still be useful for sending out long messages to the entire team/individuals. I'm interested in integrating it with hipchat or slack if thats possible - like having a channel that is a feed of all emails sent to the company mailing list. I'll explore that idea further. |
