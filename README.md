# Personal Knowledgebase
## Author: Nick Dupoux [@njdup](https://github.com/njdup)

Purpose
=======
This collection of documents, utilities, and scripts will serve as a toolset
for organizing all of the knowledge in my life. Within this repository, I plan
to store all notes worth-taking, links to all resources worth perusing, and
all tools, either personally built or acquired, worth using.
