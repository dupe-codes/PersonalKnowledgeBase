# Current Plans for this Personal Knowledgebase
## Main Plans
- House everything within this git repository under strict version control
- Take notes in markdown, written in Vim
    - Use github API to convert markdown notes to HTML
    - Create links between documents and table of contents so notes can be
    easily traversed
- Write script to extract todo list from Todoist, have up to date here
    - Potentially replace use of Todoist with my own todo system?
- Automate updating of todo list and conversion of markdown to HTML

## Fun Subplans
- Write a live-streaming twitter feed script
