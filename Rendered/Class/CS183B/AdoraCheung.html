<p>Building Product, Talking to Users, and Growing </p>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-pre-requisites" class="anchor" href="#pre-requisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pre-Requisites</h1>

<ul>
<li>Have a lot of time on your hand

<ul>
<li>Better to spend a few days in a row focused solely on your idea than to spend a few hours here and there</li>
<li>Kind of like coding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-the-noob-approach" class="anchor" href="#the-noob-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The nOOb approach</h1>

<ol>
<li>Build product in secret</li>
<li>exclusive press launch!</li>
<li>wait for users</li>
<li>buy users</li>
<li>give up
Adora: I didnt even launch on techcrunch when in YC, which was a bad idea.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-problem" class="anchor" href="#problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem</h1>

<p>What is it? You should be able to describe it in one sentence.
How does it relate to you? You need to be passionate
Verify others have it - go out and talk to people!</p>

<p>Adora: when my brother and I started our first company, we wanted to make people happy and wanted to be impactful
    - We asked, who make people happy? Life coaches and therapists.
    So, we made a platform for them.
    - But, we are not people who would use life coaches and therapists... so we were not passionate about it</p>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-where-to-start" class="anchor" href="#where-to-start" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where to start?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Learn a lot. Become an expert.

<ul>
<li>Immerse yourself in your chosen industry</li>
<li>Become a cog in it</li>
<li>People say "to disrupt an industry, you should not be a player in it. You would be set in your ways."

<ul>
<li>But as a noob, you really need to understand the bits and pieces of your industry</li>
<li>When you get down to the bits and pieces, you can find what you can exploit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adora: When we started Homejoy, we started by just being cleaner. We cleaned houses ourselves.

<ul>
<li>We learned that we were really bad at it.. we bought books to read, but you can not learn just by reading</li>
<li>We decided one of us needed to learn how to clean, so we went to get a job at a cleaning company ourselves</li>
<li>Learned to clean, but even better I learned about how a local cleaning company works

<ul>
<li>Learned why a local cleaning company could not grow to the size Homejoy is today</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If working on a service, you should go do that service yourself. Get in your customers shoes</li>
<li>You should be obsessed.

<ul>
<li>Look into EVERY competitor, read everything you can find about them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There should be no doubt you are an expert so people can trust what you are building</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify customer segments

<ul>
<li>At the early stages, you want to focus on a small segment of your customers to really optimize the experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storyboard ideal user experience

<ul>
<li>Not just the website, but also how the customer finds out about you, learns about you, what you are communicating, etc.</li>
<li>Also go into what happens after they use your product. Do they leave a review, or leave comments?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-what-is-v1" class="anchor" href="#what-is-v1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is V1?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Minimal Viable Product

<ul>
<li>A lot of people skip the viable part. The user experience at the beginning should not be flat</li>
<li>What is the smallest feature set to solve the problem you are trying to solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simple product positioning

<ul>
<li>You should be able to go to a person and say "this does x y and x" within a sentence

<ul>
<li>At HomeJoy, we started off with something really complicated. People would get bored after the first few sentences. </li>
<li>The oneliner is really important, it describes the functional benefits of what you are building</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-first-few-users" class="anchor" href="#first-few-users" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First few users</h1>

<ul>
<li>YOU! </li>
<li>Your mom, friends, + co-workers</li>
<li>Beyond that you should get more user feedback

<ul>
<li>Online communities, e.g. HN, reddit</li>
<li>Local communities, e.g. mailing lists</li>
<li>niche influencers, e.g. mommy bloggers</li>
<li>cold calls + emails</li>
<li>press
Adora: Went to a Castro street fair and handed out water bottles on a hot day... Kinda guilt tripped them into booking a cleaning, but it worked, people did not cancel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another YC company replacing the process of shipping things went to post office lines and got people out of line and tried to convince them to use their product. - Shype maybe?</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-customer-feedback" class="anchor" href="#customer-feedback" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customer Feedback</h1>

<p>Make sure there is a way for people to contact you!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="mailto:support@blank.com">support@blank.com</a> is very important!</li>
<li>Need to get out there and ask people who are using your product what they think</li>
<li>surveys: ok// interviews: better

<ul>
<li>In interviews, do not treat it like a laboratory setting, poking with questions</li>
<li>Treat it was a conversation, make people comfortable.</li>
<li>Adora: I found taking people out for drinks was a great way to do that!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>quantitative: retention, ratings, NPS

<ul>
<li>Are people who came in today still using our product tomorrow?</li>
<li>How likely are they to reccommend the product to a friend?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>qualitative: ask why, why, why</li>
<li>beware of honesty curve

<ul>
<li>Free Product:

<ul>
<li>Mom kinda honest</li>
<li>Your friends will give you some good honest feedback, support you</li>
<li>Random people? Do not really care, not the best feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paid product:

<ul>
<li>Mom will flat out lie, she is proud of you</li>
<li>Friends still pretty honest</li>
<li>But random customers will be REALLY honest, because they are paying a price for your product

<a id="user-content-v1-feature-creep" class="anchor" href="#v1-feature-creep" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>v1 feature creep</h1>

<ul>
<li>Build fast, but optimize for now</li>
<li>manual before automation

<ul>
<li>Process is important as you scale, but you should manually do things your self

<ul>
<li>Need to learn what the automation should do</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Temp brokenness &gt; permanent analysis

<ul>
<li>Do not worry about all the edge cases, worry about the generic case.</li>
<li>Then as you get bigger, the volume of the edge cases will excuse and then you can tackle them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beware of frankenstein

<ul>
<li>You should listen to user feedback</li>
<li>But when someone tells you to build a feature, you should not go and build it right away

<ul>
<li>Get to the bottom line of why they are asking for that feature</li>
<li>Usually what they are suggesting is not the best way to solve the underlying problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Someone will steal your idea...

<ul>
<li>If you have a really good idea, someone is gonna try to catch up with you</li>
<li>No point in holding out on all the user feedback you would get</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a first-mover advntage
... just launch it already!</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be tempted to try many different strategies for growth at once. But you should instead: </p>

<ul>
<li>Learn one channel at a time

<ul>
<li>Focus on one strategy for a week or so, and figure out how it works</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iterate working channels

<ul>
<li>When you find channels that work, always iterate to make them better</li>
<li>Channels always change, you need to change with them</li>
<li>Environments you do not control change all the time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>revisit failed channels</li>
</ul>

<p>key = creativity</p>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-types-of-growth" class="anchor" href="#types-of-growth" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>types of growth</h1>

<ol>
<li>sticky growth

<ul>
<li>Try to get your existing users to come back and pay you more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>viral growth

<ul>
<li>Users tell their friends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>paid growth

<ul>
<li>Use your money to buy growth</li>

<p>key = sustainability</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-sticky-growth" class="anchor" href="#sticky-growth" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sticky Growth</h2>

<ul>
<li>good experience wins</li>
<li>clv + retention cohort analysis important</li>
<li>repeat users buy more and more</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-virawl-growth" class="anchor" href="#virawl-growth" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>virawl growth</h2>

<p>WOW experience + good referral programs
1. customer touch points
    - Where are people learning that they can refer other people
    - Put touch point at a time when they are highly engaged and loving you
2. program mechanics
    - You get $10 and your friend gets $10 if you invite them
    - Optimize for what works for you
3. referral conversion flow
    - Optimize the conversion flow of a friend who was referred becoming a new user</p>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-the-art-of-pivoting" class="anchor" href="#the-art-of-pivoting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>the art of pivoting</h1>

<p>Look at these three criteria
1. bad growth
2. bad retention
3. bad economics</p>

<p>You should have a growth plan when you start out, what is an optimistic but realistic way to grow this business
If fully executing and working really hard, but you still go 3 or more weeks without any growth, then you are probably doing something wrong and need to reevaluate your approach/product
Make sure you do not stop if you are just in a lull. Trends are what matter</p>
