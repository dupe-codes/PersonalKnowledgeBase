<p>If you just measured by revenue, you could say that the airline industry is larger and more important than the search industry.
But the profit margins are much less (Airlines: 0.2%, Google: 21.0%), and reflected in market capitalization (Airlines: 112.4B, Google: 393B)</p>

<ul>
<li>Differences underestimated</li>
<li>Anyone who has a monopoly will pretend that they are in incredible competition</li>
<li>If you are in a very competitive business, you will say you are doing something unique that is less competitive than it looks</li>
<li>The real differences are quite big

<ul>
<li>The distortion happens because of the lies people tell about their businesses

<p>Google has a 66.4% market share of the search market</p>

<ul>
<li>Google almost never describes itself as a search engine

<ul>
<li>Sometimes says it is an advertisement company

<ul>
<li>But search advertising is a tiny part of the entire advertising industry</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>If you are a startup and want to get to monopoly, you need to start with a really small market

<ul>
<li>Over time then find ways to expand the market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Its easier to dominate a small market than a larger one</li>
<li>Bad sign if you go after a large market from the beginning</li>

<a id="user-content-characteristics-of-monopoly" class="anchor" href="#characteristics-of-monopoly" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Characteristics of Monopoly:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Proprietary Tech

<ul>
<li>Have a tech that is an order of magnitude better than the alternative</li>
<li>If you come up with something totally new, it is an infinite improvement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Network effects

<ul>

<li>Why is it valuable to the first person?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economies of scale

<ul>
<li>High fixed cost, low marginal cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Branding</p>

<ul>

<li>But branding is a real phenomenon that creates real value
&gt; The next Bill Gates will not build Microsoft... If you are copying these people, you are doing it wrong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Software businesses are exceptionally good at a lot of these characteristics, especially economies of scale. Its very easy to scale.</p></li>
<li>Its not enough just to have a monopoly, you want to build one that will last</li>
<li>You want to be the last mover

<ul>
<li>Google = the last search engine</li>
<li>Microsoft = the last OS (for a while)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most of the value exists far in the future

<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Need to explain why your breakthrough will be the last breakthrough, need to keep improving on it</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="user-content-history-of-innovation" class="anchor" href="#history-of-innovation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History of innovation</h1>

<li>Ford, Standard, Oil, Tesla, SpaceX</li>
<li>Required complex coordination, when done well gives you an incredible advantage</li>
<li>Hard to buy in to things that are super complicated</li>
<li>People would do well to look at this model of business more</li>

</li>
<li>Software

<ul>
<li>Economies of scale, low marginal cost, high adoption rate</li>
<li>You can get very fast adoption when working in the world of bits</li>
