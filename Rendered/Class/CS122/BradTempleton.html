<p>Identity, Free Will, Consciousness, Patternism, Copyable People and Would you get in the Transporter?
The meaning of existence</p>

<p>There are a lot of implications of the idea of a mind that can be copied.
Templetons Fundamental Theorem of AI: If we have figured out how to do something, it is no longer AI</p>

<p>Star Trek Transporter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vaporizes Captain Kirk and makes a copy of him down on the planet...</li>
<li>Brings up many questions about the nature of continuity and consciousness</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-consciousness" class="anchor" href="#consciousness" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consciousness</h2>

<ul>
<li>Never going to agree on what it is</li>
<li>We know more than some imagine</li>
<li>Probably present in all mammals, some birds, octupus

<ul>
<li>Things associated with consciousness (Dreaming, etc) have been observed to occur in the parts of our mind that we share with these animals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An artifact of the brain, or at least all physical evidence says this

<ul>
<li>Materialist belives that everything we see and know comes from material things</li>
<li>There is nothing supernatural</li>
<li>Generally non-religious</li>
<li>Even the deepest emotions, religious experiences, and altered states</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unconcious activity precedes conscious awareness

<ul>
<li>Example, decision to pick up a bottle of water occurs before we are even aware of it</li>
<li>This bothers people, maybe our mind is more like a parliament with a queen... the parliament makes the decision, the queen is just a figure head.</li>
<li>Maybe our inner dialogue is just an illusion

<ul>
<li>Brad: I think this is a misunderstanding of complex systems to think this.. We are complex systems, making decisions is a complex behavior so of course there is a lot of work unknown to us that must be done to accomplish it</li>
</ul>

<a name="user-content-materialistic-view" class="anchor" href="#materialistic-view" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Materialistic View</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mind and identity are products of the very physical brain</li>
<li>The brain is an evolved system</li>
<li>Its properties come from natural or sexual selection, plus upbringing</li>
<li>Upbringing and environment also plays a big role</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-dualism" class="anchor" href="#dualism" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dualism</h2>

<p>Idea that the mind and the body are two different things.. the mind/body problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Idea of a soul is a dualist view, because it is separate from the body</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-definitions-of-intelligence" class="anchor" href="#definitions-of-intelligence" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definitions of Intelligence</h2>

<ul>
<li>Turings test (updated)

<ul>
<li>You have intelligence if you behave at the level of humans in certain tasks</li>
<li>If you have something that is so like a human, maybe that is a definition of what is a human being?</li>
<li>Turns out it is easier than we thought to fool people into believing a machine is human.</li>
<li>If you doubt Turing, could you still be sure enough to deny rights?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Searles chinese room

<ul>
<li>Very opposite view from Turing</li>
<li>You can imagine an AI that is in a room filled with chinese books, and looking up the write chinese to say to have a discussion with someome in chinese</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chalmers philosophical zombies

<ul>
<li>The idea that you could make a mind that to the outside appears exactly like a mind</li>
<li>In the movie Her we demonstrate a human falling in love with an AI

<ul>
<li>Chalmer would call it a philosophical zombie. It walks like a man but is dead inside...</li>

<a name="user-content-its-a-simulation" class="anchor" href="#its-a-simulation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Its a simulation!</h2>

<p>A dirty word
    - It has an implication of not being real. Its fake
    - Its prejudging the question
    - As people have gotten better at VR, philosopher at Oxford proposed a thesis that states:
        - If you imagine at some point tech becomes advanced enough to create a convincingly believable virtual reality.
        - Would we build such a thing?
            - Yes, probably
        - How many times would we build it?
            - As often as possible
        - How do you know you are in the original? Whats the probability you are in the original... pretty small
        - A weird proof of God.. though God is a programmer named Martha
Bostrum and others "prove" we are in one
Its turtles all the way up</p>

<ul>
<li>AIs</li>
<li>Uploaded People

<ul>
<li>We look at the fact that our brains seem to be material objects.. But are wetbags of protein the only way you could have an intelligent mind</li>
<li>We able to make other intelligent minds... our offspring are intelligent midns created by use</li>
<li>Is it possible to copy the patterns of the mind into another medium?</li>
<li>If you can make a synthetic neuron which acts in everyway we can tell as a normal neuron, then a connection of neurons indistinguishable from the biological ones, and read the copy of connections in the mind of a human being... what would happen?

<ul>
<li>Could you copy the mind, an artificial copy of an actual mind</li>
</ul>
</li>

    - Lots of great Science Fiction</p>

<a name="user-content-patternism" class="anchor" href="#patternism" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Patternism</h2>

<ul>
<li>The pattern is the identity

<ul>
<li>Not in the physical things, but in the information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waves in the river

<ul>
<li>They are formed by the arrangement of water molecules</li>

<li>Ship of Theseus, Neuron by Neuron replacement

<ul>
<li>Ancient Greek Philosopher posited that a ship goes out to sea. As it travels, things rot and are replaced. 

<ul>
<li>When the Ship finally comes back, every single part of the ship has been replaced... Is it still the Ship of Theseus???</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if we do this with nuerons in the brain.. Replace all the neurons in th ebrain with exact copies

<ul>
<li>Are you still you? If you are dead, when did you die?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your atoms replace, as do your cells (mostly)

<ul>
<li>The atoms in your body keep getting replaced</li>
<li>Part of the natural process</li>
<li>Your brain is a redundant organ, your memories and such are stored in many places in the brain</li>
<li>You are not the same matter you started off as</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identity is continuity of pattern through incremental change

<ul>
<li>A path of succession, a chain of connected successors

<ul>
<li>You can see this between your present self and your ten year old self</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identity continues through successors</li>
<li>Unusual mix of Dualism and Materialism

<ul>
<li>the pattern is in the matter, but continuity is independent of matter</li>

<p>What if you could make a copy of yourself, what does this mean for...</p>

<ul>
<li>Voting

<ul>
<li>Do you then get two votes? Or just one? Which one gets the vote?</li>
<li>If both gets a vote, it comes down to resources

<ul>
<li>Those with more money make more copies and gain more votes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Property Ownership

<ul>
<li>Does the original own all the property?</li>
<li>Some would say it would be unethical for you to make a copy and then not give any support to them</li>
<li>We lock people up if they dont provide some support to their offspring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there truly an original and a copy?

<ul>
<li>Patternist would say no, the 'copy' has an identical pattern..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the copy owe the original?</li>
<li>Does the original owe the copy?</li>
<li>Is there a duty to keep a mind running?

<ul>
<li>Is it murder to 'pause' or 'delete' a copy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are evolutionary algorithms moral?

<ul>
<li>Have some software go through different variations and measure performance... keep the ones that perform well</li>
<li>Scientists believe that we could produce AI in this way in such a way we would not fully understand</li>
<li>Ethics question: Deliberately killing off millions of copies...</li>
