<p>One of the challenges of teaching entrepreneurship is that people take the wrong approach</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend time telling stories about it

<ul>
<li>Some fun war stories, but can not generalize</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lots of attempts to teach formulas

<ul>
<li>Follow these 5 steps... build a company</li>
<li>But, there are no formulas or science</li>
<li>Every moment happens only once

<ul>
<li>Next Zuckerberg will not build a social network</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Zero to One embraces the uniqueness of great companies
Asks a series of questions, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many great businesses are not being built</li>
<li>Tell me something that is true that no one else agrees upon

<ul>
<li>Likes to ask this as an interview question</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We are taught that the truth is something everyone agrees on..</li>
<li>The right answer is one that people might not agree with

<ul>
<li>Takes a lot of courage to come up with an answer people have not thought of</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-three-answers-to-this-question" class="anchor" href="#three-answers-to-this-question" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Three Answers to this Question</h2>

<ol>
<li>There is a belief that all happy families are alike and all unhappy families are unique</li>
<li>I think the opposite is true with business</li>
<li>All unsuccessful companies are alike, caught up with the competitors</li>
</ol><p>There are two kinds of companies: competitive companies or monopolies</p>

<ul>
<li>Goal of every founder to be a monopoly business, only one in your field</li>
</ul><p>Believes that captialism and competition are antonyms</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad business to enter: Opening a restaurant

<ul>
<li>Competitive and no one ever makes money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google is THE monopoly business

<ul>
<li>Has no competition in the field of search</li>
<li>You want to be a monopoly like them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Difference is not understood because</p>

<ul>
<li>People distort it

<ul>
<li>If you run a monopoly, you do not talk about it</li>
<li>Make it sound like you are in a much larger market</li>
<li>Google: "We are a technology company!"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If running competitive business, you want to tell some unique story

<ul>
<li>Create fictional sub-market... "We're the only restaurant serving british food." But how many people want British food?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Also a subtle psychological effect</p>

<ul>
<li>We are taught that competition is valuable, safety in crowds

<ul>
<li>Lots of people getting it, must be good! Just get in line, no asking why</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is something about human nature that is herd-like, attracted to following the crowd</li>
<li>In school you are taught to compete for the same credentials...

<ul>
<li>Competition does make you better at what you are competiting in</li>
<li>Focused at beating those around you</li>
<li>But a price - Losing sight of what is really important around you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>"Battles in academia are so ferocious because the stakes are so small"</p>

<ul>
<li>Describs a sort of mass insanity, but describes the inner logic.

<ul>
<li>If the differences are small, you have to fight much harder to differentiate yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone tries to go through the same tiny door while there is a huge gate just around the corner no one wants to explore</li>
</ul><p>What does it say about our society that anyone who else socially accepted is talked out of their unique ideas?
    - People who are not able to understand what people around them are doing are able to explore their ideas fully...
    - Dynamic where the most successful in SV are described as having asbergers..
Business schools are sort of the ultimate anti-asberger dynamic
Even though rationally we should avoid competition, psychologically we find it more comfortable</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything left to be solved is hard
Trichotomy of three things: conventions, mysteries that are impossibly hard to figure out, and secrets (hard but you can figure it out)</li>
<li>A secret is at the core of all great businesses</li>
<li>Idea that there is something you can figure out that other people have not been able to yet</li>
</ol><p>In 19th century, you could look at a map and see the holes and think "I can do there and figure out whats there"
In geography, there are not many new things to think are left...
But its a mistake to extrapolate from that to ALL fields</p>

<ul>
<li>There are many fields with interesting things left to be done</li>
<li>People have explored information technology a lot in recent decades</li>
<li>But many other areas of science and tech 

<ul>
<li>Energy, transportation</li>
<li>Futuristic things of the 60s that have not been realized</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>If you think that YOU can find something that has yet to be solved, you will!</p>

<ol>
<li>Bigger picture
In 21st century there will be two modes of progress:</li>
<li>Globalization: Copying things that work, plots on x axis</li>
<li>Technology: Vertical progress, going from Zero to One (heh), which he plots of y axis
Example:
China is the epitome of globalization, just needs to copy what has worked for other nations
Over last 200 years, periods of globalization followed by enomorous technologic growth</li>
</ol><p>Periods of globalization vs tech categorized by very different ways of talking about the world</p>

<ul>
<li>Tech: First vs Third worlds</li>
<li>Globalization: Developed vs Developings

<ul>
<li>More like a pro-convergence idea</li>
<li>But when we say we are in the developed world, we are implicitly saying that we have reached a point where theres nothing else to improve</li>
<li>We should not accept this label of living the developed world</li>
<li>We should ask "How do we go about developing the so called developed world?"</li>
</ul>
</li>

<a name="user-content-working-on-secrets" class="anchor" href="#working-on-secrets" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working on Secrets</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there things educational institutions can do to promote people tackling this tough "secret" problems
Its always really good when there is something you are really passionate about, one of the resolutions I came up with is to
always value substance over status and prestigious
I would probably still go to Stanford and might still go to Law School, but I would ask a lot more questions of WHY I was doing those things
Too much of it was driven by status. Lasted 7 months in law firm where on the outside everyone wnated to get in but on the inside everyone wanted to get out
Peoples identities get so wrapped up in the things they compete for. How had I ended up there? I had taken too many of those shortcuts of valuing what was prestigious
Conclusion: Substance over Status</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think people resist that captialism and competition are antonyms?
When I present this as an idea, it always seems to be news. One of the strange dynamics at Google is that there are all these
super smart people but a very small amount have been successful in starting their own companies.
They are told that everything is going great because they have such talented people. When they start a business, they think its only
about getting the most talented people.
You talk about talent when you do not want to talk about monopoly.</p></li>
<li>What is interesting right now in the startup world?
I am always skeptical of themes. Once you have a theme, you always have quite a lot of companies in that field. You do not want
to be the 20th pizza restaurant in Palo Alto.
Big Data, Cloud Computing... really overdone, [I am] not really sure what those words mean.
Great founders know its about having a mission and a calling. If they do not do it then no one can.
A lot of the companies I am excited about have visions like that.</li>
<li><p>"Every form of injustice involves a secret..." Is there an important injustice only a small group of people recognize?
Yes but I can not tell you what it is. It would put us in an odd point if there were no more injustices left. I can speculate
on some of them. They will always sound weird when you put them forward. Looking back from 2100, I think people will say
that so many of the political and business leaders were sociopaths. Borderline sociopaths. Football is kinda where smoking was back in the 1900s... we know its bad, causes brain damage, but we are not quite ready to tackle it</p></li>
<li><p>[ Missed question, involving originality...]
Answers to "tell me something thats true..." are usually really bad. Some answers that are adequate, at least acknowledge that they are
bad answers. "I think that there should be more educational software companies, and I know how unoriginal that is."
People always thing originality is easy... but its really hard and incredibly rare.</p></li>
<li>Assessment of the success of the thiel fellowship?
It was sort of an unconventional program... Have 20 students drop out of school. 83 people have gone through the program and I think
its been a powerful experience for almost all the people that have gone through it.
We have raised about 60 million in VC funding in aggregate. It really has captured a lot around the zeitgeist.
I am always portrayed as a person who is against college. The problem with higher education is that it is too conventional. Go to Yale of go to jail... we do not want our society to be structured that way.
Lots of questions that people are asking about higher education.</li>
<li>Did you learn anything in law school that you found helpful?
Two things that apply in startup world. One part that I am always focused on is the structure of companies and how well are people
aligned. I think it is a very legal kind of framework: what are peoples alignments and motivations? You want formal and informal alignments
I like to ask founders, "how did you meet? What is the prehistory of the company?" A bad answer: "We met a week ago at a business conference."
A better answer: "We've been talking about it for a long time... Complementary skills." I will say nonlawyers in business tend to make one of two mistakes: They either think of the law as irrelevant or the law as all-important. You either end up breaking lots of laws or you probably end up handicapped by the law.</li>
<li>Can the monopoly be too big? When is it too big?
From the inside, monopoly is always a good idea. Much more debatable from the outside. They deserve the bad rep in a static world where nothing changes. A good monopoly is one that has invented something new. Apple had a monopoly on the iPhone/smartphones. In a dynamic context, that is a monopoly that creates something new, which is good. The question is: how static is technology? I think the gov has gotten wrong historically. Went after IBM just when things were going from hardware to software... Very often the intervention has been a little too late.</li>
<li>What is the relationship between keeping a secret and disclosing it? When should companies disclose their secrets?
If you tell nobody about it, theres not much you can do with it. If you tell everyone, ends up diluting it. I define a great company
as a group of people who have a secret. You tell just the right amount of people, the people in the company.
I am skeptical about patent laws, I do not think they work well in practice, but the idea behind them is a good one. How do you preserve your secret in a way that is valuable for a long time?</li>
<li><p>Twitter comments
There always are sensitive microphones all over the place. Comments to the effect of "I think it is a rather mismanaged company. Maybe lots of marijuana smoking going on.." I think Twitter is actually a fantastic business... fantastic core idea. You do not have to be operationally that airtight as a monopoly business. When you have a business like Twitter, you often do not have to be run all that wel When you have a business like Twitter, you often do not have to be run all that welll</p></li>
<li><p>Influence of libertarian philosophy on your thinking
I describe myself as libertarian in that I am socially liberal and fiscally more conservative. I am more of a
political atheist. I do no believe that the political system is where we solve our problems. I do not think things
will change that much. I focus on tech as a way to change things.
Could the gov be doing more to foster tech and science? It seems much less capable of doing things today, but has in the past.
You get a sense that you could not do a Manhattan project or the Apollo program today. I think we should explore why there
has been such a decline in competence today.</p></li>
<li>Star Trek or Star Wars?
Pro-Star Wars, because star wars is pro capitalist and star trek is more communist. The whole plot line is driven by the fact that
Han Solo needs to pay off his debts.</li>
